# .NET OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect Server

This project is a fully functional OAuth 2.0 and OpenID Connect authorization server built with ASP.NET Core, OpenIddict, and Entity Framework Core.

It implements modern authentication and authorization standards using a clean, extensible design. Token issuance, validation, and consent flows are handled through OpenIddict, while EF Core manages the underlying data models and persistence.

The server supports standard grant types (authorization code, client credentials, password, and refresh tokens), scopes, client registration, and token revocation — all integrated into a secure, modular architecture that can be adapted for APIs, SPAs, mobile apps, or identity federation scenarios.

This project serves as a reference implementation for understanding how to build a standards-compliant, production-ready auth server using native .NET technologies — no IdentityServer, no third-party black boxes.
